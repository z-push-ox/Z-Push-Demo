Z-Push-Demo
=========

The aim of this project is to provide you with the means to evaluate the capabilities of [z-push-ox](https://github.com/z-push-ox/z-push-ox) - an openxchange zpush backend. To achieve this goal we have set up an openshift instance which is configured against the openxchange test server ox.io.

For this to work you need an [ox.io](https://www.ox.io/) account.
